# Software for Open Networking in the Cloud (SONiC)

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is SONiC a Linux distribution?
No, SONiC is a collection of networking software components required to have a fully functional Layer 3 device that can be agnostic of any particular Linux distribution. Today SONiC runs on Debian.

-------------------------------------

#### Does SONiC have any hardware?
No, SONiC is purely a software offering.

-------------------------------------

#### Is Microsoft going to sell SONiC?
No, Microsoft has no plans to sell SONiC to customers or provide any network engineering or development support.

-------------------------------------

#### Where is Microsoft planning on deploying SONiC?
SONiC is deployed in the Microsoft cloud data center infrastructure.  

-------------------------------------

#### Is SONiC what was formerly the Azure Cloud Switch (ACS)?
Mostly, ACS builds on top of SONiC with internal cloud management applications. 

-------------------------------------

#### Is SONiC deployed in Microsoft datacenters today?
Yes, SONiC is deployed in Microsoft production data centers.

-------------------------------------

#### How many devices are SONiC based?
The deployment is currently small but growing and we plan to rapidly expand SONiC deployment over the coming months. 

-------------------------------------

#### Which hardware platforms and ASIC chipset are you running SONiC on?
From our demo in the Microsoft booth you can see switches and chipsets that SONiC is running on. We can’t comment on the hardware deployed in our production network.
